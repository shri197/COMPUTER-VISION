**Real time Face Mask Detection**</br>
This project is based on Real time Face mask detection using local webcam.</br>
The model has been trained on images with and without mask where saved model has been loaded to make prediction.<br/>
Using OpenCV, and TensorFlow/Keras face detector model has been created with deep learning and computer vision.
